Hi! Welcome to my blog where I'll be documenting my journey learning to use AI coding tools on modern data platforms like Databricks.

## Why I'm Starting This

People won't stop talking about AI coding tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot. They seem to be everywhere, and honestly, I've been curious—and a bit skeptical—about whether they actually help with real data work.

I'm a data scientist, and I noticed there's not much out there about using these AI tools specifically for data science, engineering, and analytics. Most tutorials focus on web development or generic coding examples, which... isn't really what I do day-to-day.

So I figured: why not try it out myself and document what I learn? Maybe it'll be helpful for others who are in the same boat.

## What I'm Planning to Explore

Here are some things I want to figure out (and write about as I go):

### Getting Started
- How to actually set up these tools on Databricks (this took me longer than I'd like to admit)
- When these AI assistants are actually helpful vs. when they just get in the way
- Building data pipelines and seeing where AI helps
- Understanding local vs. remote development workflows

### Going Deeper
- Can AI help debug Spark jobs? (I spend way too much time on this)
- Using MLflow for tracking experiments with AI assistance
- Working with Unity Catalog and schemas
- Learning how to prompt these tools effectively for data tasks
- Setting up CI/CD for data projects

### Team & Production Stuff
- What does code review look like when AI generates code?
- How do teams share what they learn about these tools?
- What about security and governance? (this is a big one)
- Does this actually make me more productive, or is it just hype?

## Who Might Find This Useful?

If you work with data and Databricks—whether you're a data engineer, data scientist, ML engineer, or analytics engineer—and you're curious about these AI coding tools, then we're probably in the same boat. I'm figuring this out as I go, so expect plenty of "here's what worked" and "here's what definitely didn't work."

## Full Transparency

I'm not an expert in AI coding assistants. I'm learning this stuff right alongside you. I'll share the wins and the frustrations, the time-savers and the time-wasters. Some things will probably work great, and some things will probably fall flat.

I'm also still learning data engineering and ML best practices, so if you see something that could be done better, please let me know! I'd love to hear about your experiences too.

## What's Next?

My next post will probably be about why I think data folks should at least try these AI tools (spoiler: I'm still forming my opinion). After that, I'll share how I got my development environment set up—including all the stuff that went wrong the first time.

## Come Along for the Ride

If this sounds interesting, feel free to follow along:

- ⭐ I'll be sharing code examples on [GitHub](https://github.com/niveditanpatil) soon
- 🔗 Connect on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile) if you want 

## Let's Learn Together

Whether these tools turn out to be game-changers or just overhyped toys, at least we'll find out together.

Thanks for being here!
