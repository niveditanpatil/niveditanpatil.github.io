Hi! I'm documenting my journey learning to use AI coding tools, exploring data platforms, and figuring out what actually works in data science and engineering.

## What This Is About

I'm a data professional, and I'm trying to figure out if/how AI coding assistants, new data tools, and modern workflows actually help with real data work. Instead of just reading about it, I decided to try it out myself and share what I learn—the good, the bad, and the "why isn't this working?!"

If you work with data and you're curious about these tools and techniques, maybe my experiments will save you some time (or at least some frustration).

## What I'm Exploring

- 🔧 Setting up AI coding tools for data work (harder than I thought it wuold be)
- 💡 When AI actually helps vs. when it just gets in the way
- 🚀 Practical workflows for data science, engineering, and analytics
- 🤔 Whether this actually makes me more productive
- 📝 What I'm learning about working with modern data platforms
- 🎯 Prompt engineering patterns for data tasks
