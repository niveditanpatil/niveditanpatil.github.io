title: "Learning AI-Augmented Databricks Development"
---

Hey! I'm documenting my journey learning to use AI coding assistants like Cursor and GitHub Copilot with Databricks.

## What This Is About

I'm a data professional working with Databricks, and I'm trying to figure out if/how AI coding tools actually help with real data work. Instead of just reading about it, I decided to try it out myself and share what I learn—the good, the bad, and the "why isn't this working?!"

If you work with data and you're curious about these AI tools, maybe my experiments will save you some time (or at least some frustration).

## What I'm Exploring

- 🔧 Setting up AI tools to work with Databricks (harder than it looks)
- 💡 When AI actually helps vs. when it just gets in the way
- 🚀 Practical workflows for data engineering and analytics
- 🤔 Whether this actually makes me more productive
- 📝 What I'm learning about prompt engineering for data tasks
