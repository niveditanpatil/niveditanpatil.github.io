Hi, I'm Nivedita! 👋

I'm a data professional who works with Databricks and recently got curious about whether AI coding assistants actually help with real data work. So I decided to try them out and document what I learn.

## About This Blog

This blog is basically my learning journal. I'm experimenting with tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot to see how (or if) they help with Databricks development—building pipelines, debugging Spark jobs, working with MLflow, all that stuff.

I'm sharing:

- **What I'm trying** - Setup steps, workflows, experiments
- **What's working** - When AI tools actually save time or help me learn
- **What's not working** - The frustrations, the confusing parts, the "wait, why did it do that?"
- **What I'm learning** - Patterns, tips, and realizations along the way

## Why I'm Doing This

I noticed there's not much practical content out there about using AI coding assistants specifically for data engineering and analytics work on Databricks. Most tutorials are geared toward web developers or generic software engineering.

I figured if I'm learning this anyway, I might as well document it. Maybe it'll help someone else who's in the same boat.

## Full Disclosure

I'm not an expert in AI coding tools—I'm literally learning as I go. I'll probably make mistakes, miss things, or change my mind about what works. If you have suggestions or spot something I could do better, please let me know! I'm genuinely here to learn.
