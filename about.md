Hi, I'm Nivedita! 👋

I'm a data professional who's been curious about whether AI coding assistants and modern data tools actually help with real data work. So I decided to try them out and document what I learn.

## About This Blog

This blog is basically my learning journal. I'm experimenting with AI coding tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot, trying out different data platforms like Databricks, and figuring out what actually helps with data science and engineering work—building pipelines, training models, debugging distributed jobs, all that stuff.

I'm sharing:

- **What I'm trying** - Setup steps, workflows, experiments
- **What's working** - When AI tools actually save time or help me learn
- **What's not working** - The frustrations, the confusing parts, the "wait, why did it do that?"
- **What I'm learning** - Patterns, tips, and realizations along the way

## Why I'm Doing This

I noticed there's not much practical content out there about using AI coding assistants specifically for data science and engineering work. Most tutorials are geared toward web developers or generic software engineering.

I figured if I'm learning this anyway, I might as well document it. Maybe it'll help someone else who's in the same boat.

## Full Disclosure

I'm not an expert in AI coding tools—I'm literally learning as I go. I'll probably make mistakes, miss things, or change my mind about what works. If you have suggestions or spot something I could do better, please let me know! I'm genuinely here to learn.
